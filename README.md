# CSE360 Project
With a team of four people, we are to collectively create a Student Question and Answer System for our CSE 360 Project. The program will attempt to implement the features and requirements given to us by the given user stories. Our code is built off some foundational code given to us that we are to modify to implement our program. Application, program, and other similar words will be use synonymously.
